All 12 queries from HW_1 have been converted, except for query number 4.
To populate the database we converted tables from SQL into json files with the 'migration_to_json.py' script. 
Then using the 'import_to_mongodb.sh' bash script the json files were imported to mongodb, using mongosh, to a database called 'soccer_db'. 
This way we have a one-to-one relation between SQL tables and MongoDB collections.

Queries are executed with the MongoDB Python library
